## Epic Overview
### Business Context
Patients and caregivers face significant challenges managing health records scattered across multiple healthcare providers and systems. This fragmentation makes it difficult to maintain a complete health history, track changes over time, and share information effectively with healthcare teams. A unified Clinical Data Store (CDS) is essential for comprehensive health data management.

#### Data Management Capabilities
1. Data Import and Storage
   - Consolidate health records from various sources and digital formats
   - Support structured data (e.g., FHIR) and unstructured data (e.g., PDF, OCR documents, images)
   - Enable multiple data entry methods (manual and automated)

2. Data Standardization
   - Implement healthcare standards (FHIR, DICOM, LOINC, SNOMED-CT, ICD-10)
   - Transform various import formats (JSON, CSV, PDF) to standard FHIR R4 JSON
   - Ensure consistent conversion to standards data structures and terminology

3. Data Processing
   - Perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) for medical terms in unstructured data
   - Enrich data using medical terminologies and dictionaries in unstructured data or non FHIR data
   - Process and integrate unstructured data

4. Security and Sharing
   - Enable FHIR-based data exchange with healthcare providers
   - Ensure data privacy and security compliance
   - Implement secure access controls

### Features
1. Data Management
   - Multi-source and multi-formathealth data import
   - Standardized data storage and organization
   - Real-time data synchronization
   
2. Data Quality
   - Automated data classification
   - Data quality validation and enhancement
   - Version history and change tracking

3. Integration
   - Interoperability with healthcare systems
   - Unstructured data parsing and integration
   - Natural language processing for medical documents
