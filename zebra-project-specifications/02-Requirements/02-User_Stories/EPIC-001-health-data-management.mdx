## Epic Overview
### Business Context
Patients and caregivers face significant challenges managing health records scattered across multiple healthcare providers and systems. This fragmentation makes it difficult to maintain a complete health history, track changes over time, and share information effectively with healthcare teams. A unified Clinical Data Store (CDS) is essential to:
- Consolidate health records from various sources and digital and physical formats
- Standardize data formats using healthcare standards (FHIR, DICOM, LOINC)
- Enable secure data sharing with healthcare providers
- Support informed healthcare decisions
- Ensure data privacy and security compliance

### Features
- Health data import from multiple sources including physical and digital formats
- Standardized data storage and organization
- Data quality validation and enhancement
- Secure data sharing capabilities
- Automated data classification
- Version history and change tracking
- Real-time data synchronization
- Interoperability with healthcare systems
- Unstructured data parsing and integration
- Natural language processing for medical documents
