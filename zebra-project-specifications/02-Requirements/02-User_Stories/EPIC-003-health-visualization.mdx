## Epic Overview
### Business Context
Healthcare stakeholders require intuitive and comprehensive visualization tools to effectively understand and manage health data. Current systems often present data in complex, text-heavy formats that are difficult to interpret, leading to reduced efficiency in healthcare delivery and patient engagement.

### Description
A comprehensive health visualization system that enables users to view and interact with health data through multiple visualization levels, from basic tables to advanced 3D models. The system supports various visualization needs:

1. Basic Data Visualization
   - Patient demographics, history, and insurance data
   - Clinical data (vital signs, lab results, imagin, diagnostic reports, etc.)
   - Care management information
   - Searchable and filterable data views

2. Intermediate Visualization
   - Customizable dashboards and widgets
   - Temporal data analysis
   - Specialty, body systems and body regions-specific views
   - Condition and treatment tracking

3. Advanced Visualization
   - Interactive 3D body models
   - Anatomical mapping
   - Body systems visualization
   - Real-time data visualization
