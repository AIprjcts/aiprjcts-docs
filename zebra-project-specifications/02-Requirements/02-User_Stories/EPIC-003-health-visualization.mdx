## Epic Overview
### Business Context
Healthcare stakeholders require intuitive and comprehensive visualization tools to effectively understand and manage health data. Current systems often present data in complex, text-heavy formats that are difficult to interpret, leading to reduced efficiency in healthcare delivery and patient engagement.

### Description
A comprehensive health visualization system that enables users to view and interact with health data through multiple visualization levels, from basic tables to advanced 3D models. The system supports various visualization needs:

1. Basic Data Visualization
   - Patient demographics, history, and insurance data
   - Clinical data (vital signs, lab results, imaging)
   - Care management information
   - Searchable and filterable data views

2. Intermediate Visualization
   - Customizable dashboards and widgets
   - Temporal data analysis
   - Specialty-specific views
   - Condition and treatment tracking

3. Advanced Visualization
   - Interactive 3D body models
   - Anatomical mapping
   - Body systems visualization

### Strategic Alignment
| Business Goal | Contribution |
|--------------|--------------|
| Enhanced Patient Care | Improves understanding and decision-making through visual health data representation |
| Healthcare Innovation | Positions the platform as a leader in modern healthcare visualization technology |
| User Empowerment | Enables users to better understand and manage their health through intuitive visualizations |
| Clinical Efficiency | Streamlines healthcare delivery through improved data visualization and analysis tools |

### Success Metrics
1. User Adoption
   - Target: 80% of users actively using basic visualization features
   - Timeline: Q2 2024

2. Clinical Impact
   - Target: 70% of healthcare providers reporting improved decision-making
   - Timeline: Q3 2024

3. Patient Engagement
   - Target: 85% patient satisfaction with visualization tools
   - Timeline: Q4 2024

## Value Streams
