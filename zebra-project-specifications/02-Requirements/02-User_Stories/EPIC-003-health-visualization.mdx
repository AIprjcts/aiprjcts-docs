## Epic Overview
### Business Context
Patients and caregivers often struggle to understand and engage with their health information due to complex, text-heavy medical records and data presentations. This challenge leads to reduced health literacy, difficulty in tracking health progress, and limited engagement in their healthcare journey. Current health applications lack intuitive visualization tools that could help patients and their caregivers better understand their health status, track changes over time, and make informed decisions about their care.

A user-friendly visualization system is essential to:
- Help patients better understand their health conditions and treatment progress
- Enable caregivers to effectively monitor and support their loved ones' health
- Improve health literacy through intuitive visual representations
- Facilitate better communication about health status between patients and their support network
- Empower users to take a more active role in their health management

### Description
A comprehensive health visualization system that enables users to view and interact with health data through multiple visualization levels, from basic tables to advanced 3D models. The system supports various visualization needs:

1. Basic Data Visualization
   - Patient demographics, history, and insurance data
   - Clinical data (vital signs, lab results, imagin, diagnostic reports, etc.)
   - Care management information
   - Searchable and filterable data views

2. Intermediate Visualization
   - Customizable dashboards and widgets
   - Temporal data analysis
   - Specialty, body systems and body regions-specific views
   - Condition and treatment tracking

3. Advanced Visualization
   - Interactive 3D body models
   - Anatomical mapping
   - Body systems visualization
   - Real-time data visualization
