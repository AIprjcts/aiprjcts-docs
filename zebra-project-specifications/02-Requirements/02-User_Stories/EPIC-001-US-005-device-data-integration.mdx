## Story Details
### Business Value
This story enables automated collection and standardization of health device data into FHIR resources, ensuring continuous health monitoring and data accuracy. It supports real-time health tracking through RESTful APIs, webhooks, and standardized FHIR observations, enabling seamless integration with healthcare systems while maintaining data integrity and security.

### User Story
As a user with health monitoring devices and applications,
I want seamless integration of my device data through standard APIs and webhooks,
So that I can automatically collect, standardize, and track my health measurements in FHIR format.

## Acceptance Criteria
### Scenario 1: API Integration
**Given** I have a health monitoring device/app with API capabilities
**When** I set up the integration
**Then** the system should:
- Support REST API integration
- Enable OAuth2 authentication
- Accept FHIR-formatted data
- Handle batch submissions
- Validate incoming data
- Process asynchronously
- Support rate limiting
- Manage API versioning

### Scenario 2: Webhook Integration
**Given** I have devices that support webhooks
**When** new measurements are taken
**Then** it should:
- Accept webhook notifications
- Verify webhook signatures
- Process real-time updates
- Handle retry mechanisms
- Support subscription management
- Track delivery status
- Validate payload format
- Maintain webhook security

### Scenario 3: FHIR Resource Creation
**Given** device data is received
**When** processing the data
**Then** it should:
- Create Observation resources
- Link to Patient context
- Add device metadata
- Set correct codes
- Include units
- Maintain provenance
- Support bulk creation
- Enable search indexing
