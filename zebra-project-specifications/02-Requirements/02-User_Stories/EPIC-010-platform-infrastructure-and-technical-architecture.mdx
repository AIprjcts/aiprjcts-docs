## Epic Details
### Business Value
This epic establishes the foundational technical infrastructure and architecture that enables the entire platform's functionality. By providing a robust, scalable, and maintainable technical foundation, it ensures the system can deliver high performance, reliability, and security while supporting seamless integration of core technologies. This directly supports the goal of creating a unified health data platform that can scale with user needs and adapt to evolving healthcare technologies.

### Epic Description
As a platform architect or developer,
I want to establish and maintain a robust technical infrastructure with clear architecture patterns,
So that we can build a scalable, maintainable, and high-performance health data platform that meets user needs and technical requirements.
