## Story Details
### Business Value
This story enables two key aspects of health data transformation:
1. File Format Transformation: Converting diverse file formats into FHIR R4 JSON format for system compatibility
2. Schema/Content Transformation: Mapping data models and standardizing terminology for semantic interoperability

These capabilities reduce data fragmentation, improve interoperability, and enable better health data analysis while maintaining data quality and accuracy.

### User Story
As a user with diverse health records,
I want to select and control how my health data is transformed into FHIR standards,
So that I can ensure accurate and appropriate conversion of my health information.

## Acceptance Criteria
### Scenario 1: Input Format Validation
**Given** I have structured health data in various formats (JSON, XML, CSV)
**When** I submit it for processing
**Then** the system should:
- Detect the input format type
- Validate format syntax is well-formed
- Report any format validation issues
- Extract content for transformation
- Log validation results
- Provide clear error messages

### Scenario 2: Transformation Strategy Selection
**Given** I have validated structured data
**When** the system analyzes my data
**Then** it should:
- Analyze data structure and content
- Recommend suitable transformation approaches:
  * Template-based mapping
  * LLM-assisted transformation
  * GUI-based mapping tools
  * Custom transformation rules
- Present pros and cons of each approach
- Allow me to preview each method
- Let me select preferred approach
- Enable me to combine approaches if needed

### Scenario 3: Transformation Control
**Given** I have selected a transformation strategy
**When** the transformation process begins
**Then** I should be able to:
- Review proposed mappings
- Adjust transformation rules
- Test transformations
- Preview FHIR output
- Modify terminology mappings
- Verify semantic accuracy
- Approve or reject results
- Change strategy if needed
