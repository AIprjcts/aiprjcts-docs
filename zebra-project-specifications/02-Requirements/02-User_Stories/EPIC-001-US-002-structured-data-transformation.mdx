## Story Details
### Business Value
This story enables the transformation of diverse health data formats into standardized FHIR R4 resources, ensuring consistent data representation and terminology usage. It reduces data fragmentation, improves interoperability, and enables better health data analysis through standardized formats and codes. The automated transformation processes save time while maintaining data quality and accuracy.

### User Story
As a user with diverse health records in various formats,
I want automated transformation of my health data into FHIR standards with accurate terminology mapping,
So that all my health information follows consistent formats and uses standard medical terminology.

## Acceptance Criteria
### Scenario 1: Structured Data Transformation
**Given** I have structured non-FHIR health data (JSON, XML, CSV)
**When** I submit it for processing
**Then** the system should:
- Allow me to select the input format or let the system detect it automatically
- Allow me to select the kind of transformation to apply (Support LLM-assisted conversion, template-based and mapping GUI,..)
- Apply appropriate transformation rules
- Map to standard terminologies
- Preview results FHIR R4 resources and validate
- Enable human review and adjust the process if needed
- Log all transformations
- Provide transformation report

## Scenario 2: Transformation and Mapping Management
**Given** I have created templates, mappings or custom pipelines
**When** managing them
**Then** I should be able to:
- Save mapping templates
- Choose mappings for transformations scenarios
- Version control
- Test mappings
- Update existing
- Review and adjust

### Scenario 3: Terminology Standardization
**Given** I have health data with various medical terms
**When** the system processes the content
**Then** it should:
- Identify clinical concepts
- Query terminology services
- Map to standard codes (SNOMED-CT, LOINC, etc.)
- Handle multiple vocabularies
- Track mapping confidence
- Flag uncertain mappings
- Enable manual review
- Maintain terminology versions

### Scenario 4: Quality Validation
**Given** transformed FHIR resources
**When** validating the transformation
**Then** it should:
- Verify FHIR compliance
- Validate terminology usage
- Check reference integrity
- Assess data completeness
- Generate quality metrics
- Identify potential issues
- Create validation report
- Enable issue resolution

### Quality Attributes
