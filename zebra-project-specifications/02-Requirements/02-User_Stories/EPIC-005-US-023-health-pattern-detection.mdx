## Story Details
### Business Value
This story empowers users to identify and understand health patterns through AI-driven analysis, enabling proactive health management and informed decision-making. By detecting trends and anomalies, users can gain insights into their health status and take timely actions.

### User Story
As a user monitoring my health data,
I want the system to detect and highlight patterns and anomalies in my health metrics,
So that I can understand my health trends and make informed decisions about my well-being.

## Acceptance Criteria
### Scenario 1: Basic Trend Identification
**Given** I have historical health data
**When** I request pattern detection
**Then** the system should:
- Analyze data for common trends
- Highlight significant changes
- Provide visual trend lines
- Offer explanations for trends
- Suggest potential causes
- Allow filtering by time range
- Enable comparison with benchmarks
- Provide confidence levels for trends

### Scenario 2: Anomaly Detection
**Given** I am monitoring my health metrics
**When** an anomaly is detected
**Then** the system should:
- Alert me to the anomaly
- Explain the potential impact
- Suggest possible causes
- Recommend actions to investigate
- Provide historical context
- Allow user feedback on accuracy
- Enable anomaly tracking over time
- Offer options to ignore or flag anomalies

### Scenario 3: Interactive Pattern Exploration
**Given** I want to explore detected patterns
**When** I interact with the pattern detection tool
**Then** I should be able to:
- Drill down into specific data points
- View detailed pattern explanations
- Access related health information
- Customize pattern detection settings
- Save and share pattern reports
- Compare patterns across different metrics
- Integrate new data sources for analysis
- Receive updates on pattern changes
