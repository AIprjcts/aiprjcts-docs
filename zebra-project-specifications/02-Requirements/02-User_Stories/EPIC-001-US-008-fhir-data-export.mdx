## Acceptance Criteria
### Scenario 1: FHIR-Based Export
**Given** I need to share health data in FHIR format
**When** I initiate a FHIR export
**Then** the system should:
- Generate valid FHIR bundles
- Include all relevant resources
- Maintain resource relationships
- Validate export package
- Support bulk operations
- Compress large exports
- Track export activities
- Provide download links

### Scenario 2: Alternative Format Export
**Given** I need health data in a specific format
**When** I select an export format (PDF, CSV, CDA, JSON, XML)
**Then** the system should:
- Transform FHIR resources to selected format
- Maintain data fidelity
- Preserve clinical context
- Apply format-specific validations
- Include metadata and provenance
- Support batch conversion
- Generate format-appropriate structure
- Provide format documentation

### Scenario 3: Provider Sharing
**Given** I want to share with healthcare providers
**When** I set up sharing permissions
**Then** it should:
- Enable provider selection
- Configure access levels
- Set sharing duration
- Generate secure access tokens
- Support SMART on FHIR
- Log access events
- Enable revocation
- Notify relevant parties

### Scenario 4: Emergency Access
**Given** emergency access is needed
**When** emergency mode is activated
**Then** it should:
- Enable rapid access
- Share critical information
- Maintain access logs
- Notify data owner
- Limit access duration
- Track usage patterns
- Support override codes
- Restore normal access
