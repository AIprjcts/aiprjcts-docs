## Story Details
### Business Value
This story enables healthcare providers and patients to understand complex health conditions through system-based mapping, showing relationships between different body systems and conditions. It improves clinical decision-making, patient education, and treatment planning through comprehensive visualization of system interactions.

### User Story
As a healthcare provider or patient dealing with complex medical conditions,
I want to visualize and understand the relationships between different body systems and health conditions,
So that I can make better-informed decisions about treatment approaches and understand system interactions.
