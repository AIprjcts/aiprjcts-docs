## Story Details
As a patient with a rare disease,
I want to visualize how my condition has progressed over time across different body systems,
So that I can better understand my health journey and communicate changes to my healthcare team.

## Business Value
- Enables tracking of condition development
- Supports early detection of changes
- Improves patient-provider communication
- Facilitates treatment evaluation

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Shows condition changes over time using:
   - Color coding for severity
   - Size indicators for affected areas
   - Progression markers on timeline
2. Supports multiple visualization modes:
   - 3D body model progression
   - Timeline-based progression
   - System-based progression
3. Includes key metrics and measurements
4. Allows comparison of different time periods
5. Highlights significant changes
6. Supports annotation of important events
7. Enables export of progression reports
8. Integrates with existing health data
