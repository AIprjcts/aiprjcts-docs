## Story Details
### Business Value
This story enables patients to accurately report and track symptoms using an intuitive 3D body model interface, improving the precision of symptom location reporting and enhancing communication with healthcare providers. The visual approach reduces ambiguity in describing symptom locations and patterns.

### User Story
As a patient tracking my health conditions,
I want to report and track my symptoms by interacting with a 3D body model,
So that I can accurately document my symptoms' location, intensity, and patterns for better communication with my healthcare team.

## Acceptance Criteria
### Scenario 1: Basic Symptom Marking
**Given** I need to report a symptom
**When** I interact with the 3D body model
**Then** I should be able to:
- Tap/click to select precise body locations
- Mark multiple points for related symptoms
- Adjust the selected area size and shape
- Save marked locations with timestamps
- Edit or remove marked locations
- View my marked locations clearly highlighted
- Zoom and rotate to access difficult areas
- Receive confirmation of saved inputs

### Scenario 2: Detailed Symptom Documentation
**Given** I am marking a symptom location
**When** I add symptom details
**Then** I should be able to:
- Rate pain/intensity on a 0-10 scale
- Select symptom types from a predefined list
- Choose multiple descriptors (sharp, dull, throbbing, etc.)
- Mark symptom frequency (constant, intermittent)
- Draw radiation patterns on the model
- Add free-text notes or voice memos
- Link to related symptoms
- Include environmental or trigger factors

### Scenario 3: Symptom History and Tracking
**Given** I have recorded symptoms over time
**When** I review my symptom history
**Then** I should be able to:
- View historical symptom patterns
- Compare symptoms across time periods
- See intensity changes over time
- Track symptom migration
- Generate timeline visualizations
- Export symptom reports
- Share data with providers
- Identify pattern changes
