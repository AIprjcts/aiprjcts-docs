## Epic Overview
### Business Context
Patients and caregivers often struggle to understand and engage with their health information due to complex, text-heavy medical records and data presentations. This challenge leads to reduced health literacy, difficulty in tracking health progress, and limited engagement in their healthcare journey. Current health applications lack intuitive visualization tools that could help patients and their caregivers better understand their health status, track changes over time, and make informed decisions about their care.

### Description
A comprehensive health visualization system that enables users to view and interact with health data through multiple visualization levels:

1. Basic Data Visualization:
   - Resource list management and search
   - Filtered and categorized views
   - Basic data visualization components
   - Mobile-optimized interfaces

2. Interactive Timeline:
   - Chronological health journey visualization
   - Event tracking and management
   - Pattern recognition and analysis
   - Goal tracking integration

3. Dashboard Management:
   - Customizable dashboards
   - Configurable widgets
   - Layout management
   - Data source integration

4. Advanced Visualization:
   - 3D body visualization
   - System-based mapping
   - Cross-system analysis
   - Interactive exploration
