## Story Details
### Business Value
This story enables users to visualize and understand their health journey through time, improving their ability to track progress, identify patterns, and make informed decisions about their healthcare. The interactive timeline provides a comprehensive view of health events and their relationships.

### User Story
As a patient or caregiver managing health information,
I want an interactive timeline of my health journey with goal tracking capabilities,
So that I can understand patterns, track progress, and make informed decisions about my care.

## Acceptance Criteria
### Scenario 1: Timeline Navigation
**Given** I am viewing my health timeline
**When** I interact with the visualization
**Then** I should be able to:
- Navigate through different time periods (day, week, month, year views)
- Zoom in to see hourly details or out to see monthly/yearly patterns
- Filter events by categories (medications, appointments, test results, symptoms)
- View detailed information by clicking on any health event
- Mark important milestones (like starting a new treatment)
- Identify recurring patterns (like seasonal allergies or medication side effects)
- Add personal notes or annotations to any event
- Generate shareable reports for healthcare providers

### Scenario 2: Goal Management
**Given** I am tracking health goals
**When** I use the timeline
**Then** I should be able to:
- Set measurable health goals (e.g., "reduce blood pressure to 120/80 by December")
- Track progress with visual indicators and progress bars
- View achievement milestones and celebrations
- Adjust targets based on progress and doctor recommendations
- Set medication and appointment reminders
- Monitor trends toward goals with visual graphs
- Share progress reports with care team
- Receive smart notifications for goal progress and reminders

### Scenario 3: Data Integration
**Given** I have multiple health data sources
**When** I view the timeline
**Then** I should see:
- Health events from all connected sources (medical records, devices, apps)
- Visual connections between related events (e.g., medication timing and symptom changes)
- Clear indicators showing relationships between events (e.g., arrows connecting a meal to subsequent blood sugar readings)
- Labels showing the source of each data point (e.g., "From: Apple Watch" or "From: Hospital EMR")
- Automatic updates when new data is available from any source
- Real-time data feeds from connected devices (e.g., heart rate monitors)
- Complete historical records with import capabilities
- Pattern analysis highlighting correlations between different health events
