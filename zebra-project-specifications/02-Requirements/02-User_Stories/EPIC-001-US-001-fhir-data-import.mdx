## Story Details
### Business Value
This story enables direct FHIR R4 data import and processing capabilities, ensuring data standardization and quality through automated validation. It provides the foundation for maintaining a unified health record repository while guaranteeing data integrity and standards compliance. The automated validation and processing reduce manual effort and potential errors, making it easier for users to maintain their health records.

### User Story
As a user managing health records,
I want to import and validate FHIR R4 JSON data through multiple methods,
So that I can ensure my health data is properly structured, validated, and maintained in a standard format.

## Acceptance Criteria
### Scenario 1: Direct FHIR Resource Upload
**Given** I have FHIR R4 JSON resources
**When** I upload them through a form using the API
**Then** the system should:
- Validate against FHIR profiles
- Check terminology bindings
- Verify resource references
- Generate OperationOutcome
- Store valid resources
- Create audit trail
- Provide validation feedback

### Scenario 2: FHIR Bundle Processing
**Given** I have a FHIR R4 bundle
**When** I submit it for processing
**Then** the system should:
- Validate entire bundle
- Process all resources
- Maintain relationships
- Handle transaction rules
- Support rollback
- Track processing status
- Report success/errors

### Scenario 3: Manual FHIR Editing
**Given** I need to modify FHIR data
**When** I use the FHIR editor
**Then** the system should:
- Provide JSON syntax highlighting
- Offer real-time validation
- Suggest valid elements
- Show terminology options
- Preview rendered resource
- Track changes
- Validate modifications
