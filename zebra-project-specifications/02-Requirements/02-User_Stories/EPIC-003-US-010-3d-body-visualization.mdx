## Story Details
### Business Value
This story enables patients with complex conditions to better understand and communicate their health status through interactive 3D visualization. By providing intuitive visual representation of conditions and their relationships, it improves health literacy, patient-provider communication, and treatment understanding.

### User Story
As a patient with complex medical conditions affecting multiple body systems,
I want an interactive 3D visualization of my health conditions and their relationships,
So that I can better understand my health status, communicate with healthcare providers, and track changes over time.
