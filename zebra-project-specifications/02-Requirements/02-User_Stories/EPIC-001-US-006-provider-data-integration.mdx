## Acceptance Criteria
### Scenario 1: Provider Connection Setup
**Given** I want to connect to my healthcare provider
**When** I initiate the connection
**Then** the system should:
- Search provider directory
- Support SMART on FHIR authorization
- Handle OAuth2 authentication
- Store secure tokens
- Verify connection status
- Save provider metadata
- Log connection details
- Enable notifications

### Scenario 2: Initial Data Import
**Given** I have established a provider connection
**When** I initiate the initial data import
**Then** the system should:
- Retrieve historical health records
- Support bulk FHIR data import
- Process all resource types
- Maintain data provenance
- Handle large datasets
- Show import progress
- Validate imported data
- Report import status

### Scenario 3: Ongoing Synchronization
**Given** I have an active provider connection
**When** new data is available at the provider
**Then** it should:
- Detect new/updated records
- Pull changes automatically
- Update local FHIR resources
- Maintain data consistency
- Track sync timestamps
- Handle conflicts
- Log sync activities
- Notify about updates

### Scenario 4: Data Reconciliation
**Given** data exists from multiple providers
**When** processing provider data
**Then** it should:
- Identify duplicate records
- Merge related information
- Maintain source references
- Handle conflicting data
- Preserve data history
- Enable manual review
- Track reconciliation decisions
- Update master records
