## Epic Overview
### Business Context
Patients and caregivers face significant challenges managing health records scattered across multiple healthcare providers and systems. This fragmentation makes it difficult to maintain a complete health history, track changes over time, and share information effectively with healthcare teams. A unified Clinical Data Store (CDS) is essential for comprehensive health data management.

#### Data Management Capabilities
1. Data Import and Storage
   - Consolidate health records from various sources and formats
   - Support structured data (e.g., FHIR) and unstructured data (e.g., PDF, OCR documents, images)
   - Enable multiple data entry methods (manual and automated)

2. Data Standardization
   - Implement healthcare standards (FHIR, DICOM, LOINC, SNOMED-CT, ICD-10)
   - Transform different import formats (JSON, CSV, PDF) to standard structured FHIR R4 JSON format using diffrent technologies and tools
   - Ensure consistent conversion from different data structures to standards data structures and schemas (FHIR R4 JSON) and terminology (SNOMED-CT, LOINC, ICD-10, RxNorm,..)

3. Data Processing
   - Execute workflows for data processing using NLP and AI/ML technologies: data validation, data transformation, data enrichment, data normalization
   - Perform Named Entity Recognition (NER), concept recognition and concept normalization for medical terms in unstructured data, non FHIR R4 JSON data or free text data inside FHIR R4 JSON data
   - Enrich data: 
         - Perform concept normalization to medical terminologies and map entities in text to standard medical codes (SNOMED-CT, LOINC, ICD-10, RxNorm,..) in unstructured data,  non FHIR R4 JSON data or free text data inside FHIR R4 JSON data
         - Perform assertion status (present, absent, conditional) for concepts 
         - Perform data enrichment
      
4. Security and Sharing
   - Enable FHIR-based data exchange with healthcare providers
   - Ensure data privacy and security compliance
   - Implement secure access controls

### Features
1. Data Management
   - Multi-source and multi-format and multi-structuredhealth data import
   - Standardized data storage and organization
   - Real-time data synchronization
   
2. Data Quality
   - Automated or semi-automated data classification when data is structured and in standarized format
   - Data quality validation and enhancement
   - Version history and change tracking

3. Integration
   - Interoperability with healthcare systems using FHIR-based data exchange
   - Unstructured, semi-structured and structured data parsing and integration
   - Natural language processing for medical documents
