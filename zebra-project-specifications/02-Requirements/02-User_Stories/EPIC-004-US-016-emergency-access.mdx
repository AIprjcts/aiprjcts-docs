## Story Details
### Business Value
This story ensures that critical health information is available during emergencies while maintaining patient privacy preferences. By enabling patients to control their emergency information access and protocols, it improves emergency response effectiveness while respecting patient autonomy and privacy rights.

### User Story
As a patient or caregiver managing health information,
I want to set up and control both emergency access protocols and critical health information,
So that authorized emergency responders can provide appropriate care while respecting my privacy preferences when I'm unable to communicate.
