## Story Details
### Business Value
This story enables seamless real-time synchronization of health data across all devices and access points, ensuring that critical health information is always up-to-date and accessible. By providing robust sync capabilities with conflict resolution and offline support, it enhances data reliability and user experience while maintaining data integrity and security.

### User Story
As a user of the health platform,
I want my health data to automatically synchronize across all my devices and access points in real-time,
So that I can always access and update my health information from anywhere, knowing it's current and consistent.

## Acceptance Criteria
### Scenario 1: Real-Time Updates
**Given** I have multiple devices accessing my health data
**When** I make changes on any device
**Then** the system should:
- Update instantly
- Notify other devices
- Show sync status
- Handle conflicts
- Maintain history
- Preserve integrity
- Track changes
- Enable rollback

### Scenario 2: Offline Support
**Given** I am working without internet connection
**When** I make changes offline
**Then** the system should:
- Store changes locally
- Queue for sync
- Show offline status
- Resolve conflicts
- Sync automatically
- Preserve order
- Notify completion
- Handle errors

### Scenario 3: Conflict Resolution
**Given** conflicting changes occur
**When** synchronization runs
**Then** the system should:
- Detect conflicts
- Apply resolution rules
- Preserve all versions
- Notify users
- Suggest resolutions
- Allow manual choice
- Log decisions
- Maintain audit trail

### Scenario 4: Multi-Device Management
**Given** I use multiple devices
**When** I manage my device access
**Then** I should be able to:
- Register devices
- Set permissions
- View sync status
- Remove devices
- Control access
- Monitor activity
- Set priorities
- Manage storage

### Scenario 5: Performance Monitoring
**Given** I am using the sync system
**When** I check sync performance
**Then** I should see:
- Sync speed
- Success rates
- Error reports
- Data usage
- Device status
- Network health
- Storage usage
- System alerts
