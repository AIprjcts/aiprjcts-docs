## Story Details
### Business Value
This story enables intelligent processing of medical documents and images, extracting structured health information while maintaining document integrity. It reduces manual data entry, improves data accessibility, and enables comprehensive health record management through automated document analysis and FHIR resource creation.

### User Story
As a user with various medical documents and images,
I want intelligent processing and analysis of my health documents,
So that I can extract structured health information while maintaining original document access and searchability.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: DICOM Processing
**Given** I have DICOM images
**When** I upload them
**Then** the system should:
- Connect to a DICOMweb server
- Store the images and studies via DICOMweb
- Create FHIR ImagingStudy resource
- Extract metadata
- Link to patient
- Enable viewing the resource

### Scenario 2: PDF Document Processing
**Given** I have medical PDFs
**When** I upload them
**Then** the system should: 
- Create FHIR DocumentReference resources
- Extract text via OCR
- Generate document previews
- Store securely with tracked upload status
- Index content for searchability
- Enable quick access

### Scenario 3: Clinical Information Extraction
**Given** processed PDF documents
**When** analyzing the content
**Then** the system should:
- Use NLP for text analysis
- Identify and extract medical entities
- Map entities to standard terminologies
- Extract measurements and relationships
- Generate clinical summaries
- Enable human verification of extracted data

### Scenario 4: FHIR Resource Creation
**Given** extracted clinical information
**When** converting to FHIR format
**Then** the system should:
- Use LLM/tools for FHIR transformation
- Create appropriate FHIR resources
- Link related FHIR resources together
- Validate FHIR compliance
- Update DocumentReference with resource links
- Track processing status
- Log all transformations
- Provide transformation report
- Enable human review of final results

### Quality Attributes
