## Story Details
### Business Value
This story enables intelligent processing of medical documents through advanced NLP and ML techniques. It extracts structured health information using named entity recognition, relationship extraction, and concept normalization while maintaining document integrity. The automated analysis reduces manual effort, improves data quality, and enables comprehensive health record management through standardized FHIR resources.

### User Story
As a user with various medical documents and images,
I want intelligent processing with advanced NLP and entity recognition,
So that I can automatically extract and standardize health information while maintaining document traceability.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Text Extraction and Preprocessing
**Given** I have medical documents (PDFs, images)
**When** processing the documents
**Then** the system should:
- Extract text via OCR with layout preservation
- Clean and normalize extracted text
- Detect document sections and structure
- Identify document type and specialty
- Preserve formatting metadata
- Handle multiple languages
- Generate searchable content
- Create document preview
- Enable text verification

### Scenario 2: Named Entity Recognition
**Given** I have extracted medical text
**When** performing NER analysis
**Then** the system should:
- Identify medical entities:
  * Problems and diagnoses
  * Medications and dosages
  * Procedures and treatments
  * Lab tests and results
  * Vital signs and measurements
  * Anatomical sites
  * Temporal expressions
- Detect entity relationships
- Determine negation status
- Identify certainty levels
- Handle overlapping entities
- Preserve entity context
- Enable entity verification

### Scenario 3: Clinical Concept Processing
**Given** I have identified medical entities
**When** normalizing the concepts
**Then** the system should:
- Map to standard terminologies:
  * SNOMED CT for clinical terms
  * RxNorm for medications
  * LOINC for lab tests
  * ICD-10 for diagnoses
- Resolve concept ambiguity
- Handle concept modifiers
- Maintain concept relationships
- Track mapping confidence
- Allow mapping verification
- Support terminology versioning

### Scenario 4: Relationship Extraction
**Given** I have normalized medical concepts
**When** analyzing relationships
**Then** the system should:
- Identify clinical relationships:
  * Problem-treatment associations
  * Medication-condition links
  * Test-result pairs
  * Temporal relationships
  * Anatomical associations
- Detect causality indicators
- Establish chronological order
- Preserve clinical context
- Enable relationship review
- Support relationship validation

### Scenario 5: FHIR Resource Generation
**Given** I have processed clinical information
**When** creating FHIR resources
**Then** the system should:
- Select appropriate FHIR resources
- Map extracted data to FHIR fields
- Maintain entity relationships
- Create resource references
- Validate FHIR compliance
- Preserve data provenance
- Link to source documents
- Enable resource review
