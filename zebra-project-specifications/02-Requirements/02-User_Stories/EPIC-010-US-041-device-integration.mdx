## Story Details
### Business Value
This story enables patients to integrate and manage their personal health devices and monitoring equipment securely. By leveraging SMART on FHIR and Medplum capabilities, it ensures interoperability, security, and real-time data synchronization, enhancing patient engagement and health data management.

### User Story
As a patient managing my health with medical devices and wearables,
I want to control and manage the integration of my personal health devices and monitoring equipment,
So that I can securely collect, understand, and share my health data while maintaining control over my privacy.

## Acceptance Criteria
### Scenario 1: Device Control
**Given** I manage my devices
**When** I configure settings
**Then** I should be able to define privacy settings, data sharing preferences, and connection permissions

### Scenario 2: Interoperability
**Given** I use multiple devices
**When** I integrate them
**Then** the system should support FHIR-based data exchange and SMART on FHIR APIs

### Scenario 3: Security
**Given** I connect a device
**When** data is transmitted
**Then** it should be encrypted and access controlled using OAuth2

### Scenario 4: Real-Time Synchronization
**Given** my devices are connected
**When** data is generated
**Then** it should sync in real-time using Medplum's APIs
