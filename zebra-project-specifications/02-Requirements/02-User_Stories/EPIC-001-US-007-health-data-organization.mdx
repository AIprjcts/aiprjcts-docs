## Acceptance Criteria
### Scenario 1: Automated Classification
**Given** I have various FHIR resources
**When** the system processes them
**Then** it should:
- Analyze resource content and types
- Apply clinical categorization
- Tag by medical specialty
- Identify conditions and episodes
- Create logical groupings
- Maintain resource relationships
- Learn from user interactions
- Allow manual adjustments

### Scenario 2: Timeline Organization
**Given** I have longitudinal health data
**When** viewing my health history
**Then** it should:
- Create chronological views
- Group by episodes of care
- Link related events
- Show clinical progression
- Enable timeline filtering
- Support custom date ranges
- Highlight significant events
- Maintain context relationships

### Scenario 3: Smart Search and Navigation
**Given** I need to find specific health information
**When** using the search functionality
**Then** it should:
- Support natural language queries
- Understand medical terminology
