## Overview
This use case describes the process of processing and converting unstructured medical documents (PDFs, scanned reports) into structured FHIR resources. It includes OCR processing, text extraction, AI-assisted content analysis, and human-in-the-loop validation for ensuring accurate conversion of medical information.

## Preconditions
1. User is authenticated and authorized in the system
2. Document is available in supported format (PDF, image)
3. OCR and AI services are operational
4. Required processing templates are available
5. Terminology services are accessible
6. Storage capacity is available

## Basic Flow
1. User initiates document processing
2. System analyzes document:
   - Format verification
   - Quality assessment
   - Page detection
   - Layout analysis
3. System performs text extraction:
   - OCR processing if needed
   - Text content extraction
   - Structure identification
4. System analyzes content:
   - Document type detection
   - Section identification
   - Key information extraction
5. System suggests FHIR mapping:
   - Resource type identification
   - Field mapping proposals
   - Terminology suggestions
6. User reviews and validates:
   - Confirms correct extractions
   - Corrects misidentifications
   - Adds missing information
7. System enriches data:
   - NER processing
   - Terminology mapping
   - Reference linking
8. User validates enrichment:
   - Reviews coded terms
   - Confirms relationships
   - Adjusts mappings
9. System generates FHIR resources
10. User performs final review
11. System saves validated resources
12. System maintains document linkage

## Alternative Flows

### Alternative Flow 1: Template Processing
**Trigger:** Known document format
1. User selects document template
2. System applies template rules
3. Extracts structured data
4. Returns to main flow at step 5

### Alternative Flow 2: Manual Processing
**Trigger:** Complex document structure
1. User selects manual processing
2. System provides extraction tools
3. User guides extraction
4. Returns to main flow at step 7

### Alternative Flow 3: Batch Documents
**Trigger:** Multiple similar documents
1. System identifies pattern
2. Creates processing template
3. Processes batch
4. Returns to main flow at step 5

## Exception Flows

### Exception 1: Poor Quality
**Trigger:** Document quality issues
**Handling:**
1. System identifies problems
2. Suggests improvements
3. Offers manual extraction

### Exception 2: Unknown Format
**Trigger:** Unrecognized document type
**Handling:**
1. System requests classification
2. Creates new template
3. Proceeds with processing

## Postconditions
1. Document is processed
2. FHIR resources are created
3. Validation is completed
4. Document is linked
5. Processing is logged

## Business Rules
- Original document must be preserved
- All extractions must be validated
- Terminology mappings must be accurate
- Processing steps must be logged
- Quality thresholds must be met
- Document links must be maintained

## Special Requirements

### Performance Requirements
- OCR processing < 30 seconds/page
- Content analysis < 1 minute
- Interactive response < 2 seconds
- Support documents up to 50MB
- Batch processing capability

### Security Requirements
- Secure document storage
- Processing audit trail
- Access control enforcement
- PHI protection
- Error handling security
