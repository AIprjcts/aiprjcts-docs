## Overview
### Description
Parent use case for comprehensive health record management, enabling patients and caregivers to process, organize, and maintain their complete health information.

### Primary Actor
- Patient/Caregiver

### Secondary Actors
- Healthcare Providers
- System Administrators
- AI/ML Systems

### Preconditions
1. User is authenticated and authorized
2. System is operational
3. Required integrations are available

### Postconditions
1. Health records are properly managed
2. Data integrity is maintained
3. Access controls are enforced
4. Audit trail is updated

## Basic Flow
1. User accesses health record management interface
2. System displays available management options:
   - Process clinical documents
   - Process lab results
   - Process medical images
   - Process medications
   - Process vital signs
3. User selects desired management action
4. System validates user permissions
5. System presents relevant interface
6. User performs management tasks
7. System validates and processes changes
8. System updates records
9. System confirms completion

## Alternative Flows
### A1. Offline Access
1. System detects offline status
2. System enables offline mode
3. User performs management tasks
4. System queues changes for sync
5. System syncs when online

### A2. Emergency Access
1. Emergency access is triggered
2. System validates emergency credentials
3. System grants temporary access
4. System logs emergency access

## Exception Flows
### E1. Validation Error
1. System detects invalid data
2. System displays error message
3. System preserves valid data
4. User corrects errors
5. Flow continues

### E2. Integration Failure
1. System detects integration issue
2. System notifies user
3. System enables offline mode
4. System retries integration later

## Special Requirements
### Performance
- Response time < 2 seconds
- Real-time updates
- Offline capability

### Security
- HIPAA compliance
- Data encryption
- Access control
- Audit logging

### Usability
