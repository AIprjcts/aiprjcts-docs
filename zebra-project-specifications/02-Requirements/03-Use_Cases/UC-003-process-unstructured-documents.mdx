## Overview
This use case describes the process of analyzing unstructured medical documents using NLP/NER capabilities, with a focus on interactive visualization and annotation tools for entity review and correction.

## Actors
- Healthcare Providers
- Medical Records Staff
- NLP System
- External NLP/NER API Services

## Preconditions
- User is authenticated
- Document is uploaded and OCR processed
- NLP/NER services are configured and available
- Required medical terminologies are accessible

## Main Flow

### 1. Document Processing
1. System receives uploaded medical document
2. Performs OCR with layout preservation
3. Extracts and normalizes text while maintaining structure
4. Segments document into logical sections

### 2. NER Processing
1. System processes text through NLP pipeline:
   - Local NER processing engine or
   - External NLP API service (e.g., John Snow Labs, AWS Comprehend Medical)
2. Identifies medical entities with confidence scores
3. Maps entities to standard terminologies
4. Stores preliminary NER results

### 3. Interactive Visualization
1. System presents document in annotation interface:
   - Original document view
   - Text view with entity highlights
   - Side-by-side comparison mode
2. Color-codes different entity types:
   - Problems/Diagnoses (e.g., Red)
   - Medications (e.g., Green)
   - Procedures (e.g., Blue)
   - Lab Tests (e.g., Purple)
   - Measurements (e.g., Orange)
   - Temporal Expressions (e.g., Yellow)
3. Displays confidence scores
4. Shows terminology mappings
5. Indicates relationships between entities

### 4. Entity Review and Correction
1. User interface provides:
   - Entity list sidebar
   - Filtering by entity type
   - Search functionality
   - Confidence score thresholds
2. Annotation tools:
   - Add new entity (click and drag)
   - Modify entity boundaries
   - Change entity type
   - Delete incorrect entities
   - Merge overlapping entities
   - Split entities
3. Terminology mapping tools:
   - View suggested mappings
   - Search terminology databases
   - Select alternative mappings
   - Add custom mappings

### 5. Relationship Management
1. Visual relationship tools:
   - Arrow connections between related entities
   - Relationship type selection
   - Temporal ordering visualization
   - Causality indication
2. Relationship editing:
   - Add/remove relationships
   - Modify relationship types
   - Set temporal order
   - Define hierarchies

### 6. Quality Assurance
1. Validation tools:
   - Missing required entities
   - Unmapped concepts
   - Low confidence scores
   - Conflicting relationships
2. Batch operations:
   - Apply corrections to similar cases
   - Bulk entity type changes
   - Mass relationship updates

## Alternative Flows

### A1. External NLP Service Unavailable
1. System switches to local NLP processing
2. Notifies user of reduced capabilities
3. Continues with available features

### A2. Low Confidence Results
1. System flags entities below threshold
2. Prioritizes them for manual review
3. Suggests alternative interpretations

## Exception Flows

### E1. Processing Failure
1. System saves partial results
2. Logs error details
3. Allows manual processing
4. Provides retry option

## Post Conditions
- Document is fully processed
- Entities are verified and corrected
- Relationships are validated
- FHIR resources are generated
- Audit trail is maintained

## Technical Requirements

### UI Components
1. Document Viewer:
   - PDF/Image rendering
   - Text overlay
   - Zoom/Pan controls
   - Page navigation

2. Annotation Interface:
   - React-based annotation tools
   - Configurable entity colors
   - Keyboard shortcuts
   - Touch-screen support

3. Entity Management:
   - Entity type selector
   - Terminology browser
   - Relationship editor
   - Validation alerts

### Backend Services
1. NLP Processing:
   - Local NER engine
   - API integration layer
   - Terminology services
   - Relationship extraction

2. Storage:
   - Document repository
   - Annotation database
   - Terminology cache
   - Audit logging

### Integration Points
1. External Services:
   - NLP/NER APIs
   - Terminology servers
   - FHIR endpoints
   - Authentication services

## Performance Requirements
- Document loading: < 2 seconds
- NER processing: < 30 seconds
- UI responsiveness: < 100ms
- Annotation saving: < 1 second

## Security Requirements
- Role-based access control
- Audit logging of changes
- Secure API communication
- Data encryption at rest

## Notes
- Consider integration with popular NLP services
- Plan for offline processing capability
- Include user training materials
- Support keyboard-only operation
- Enable batch processing for efficiency
