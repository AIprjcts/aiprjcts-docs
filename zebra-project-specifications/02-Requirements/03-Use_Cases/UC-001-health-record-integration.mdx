# Use Case: FHIR Endpoint Integration

## Metadata
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Use Case ID** | UC-001 |
| **Title** | FHIR Endpoint Integration |
| **Actor** | Patient, Family Caregiver, Healthcare Provider |
| **Scope** | System |
| **Level** | User-Goal |
| **Priority** | High |
| **Complexity** | High |

## Overview
This use case describes the process of connecting to and retrieving health information from FHIR endpoints provided by healthcare institutions. It enables automated data retrieval and synchronization with various healthcare providers' systems while maintaining data integrity and security.

## Preconditions
1. User is authenticated and authorized in the system
2. Healthcare provider supports FHIR R4 endpoints
3. User has valid credentials for the healthcare provider's system
4. Required FHIR endpoints are accessible and operational
5. System has necessary security certificates and configurations

## Basic Flow
1. User initiates FHIR endpoint connection. User begins the process to connect their health records from different providers to the aggregator's platform.
2. System presents list of supported healthcare providers. The aggregator displays a list of healthcare providers, hospitals, or clinics whose FHIR endpoints are supported for data integration.
3. User selects provider and provides authentication credentials. The user selects their specific healthcare provider and enters the necessary authentication details, which may include usernames, passwords, or OAuth consent.
4. System validates credentials with provider's FHIR endpoint. The aggregator's system authenticates the user by communicating with the provider's FHIR endpoint, ensuring that the credentials are valid and that the user has the necessary permissions.
5. System retrieves available FHIR resources list. Upon successful authentication, the system queries the FHIR server to retrieve a list of available resources associated with the user.
6. User selects desired resource types for import:
   - Patient demographics
   - Clinical observations
   - Medications
   - Conditions
   - Procedures
   - Lab results
   - Imaging studies
7. System initiates data retrieval. The system begins fetching the selected data types from the provider's FHIR endpoint. 
8. System performs data validation and normalization. Retrieved data is validated for accuracy and completeness. The system normalizes the data to ensure consistency, especially important when aggregating data from multiple providers with varying formats.
9. System presents import preview. Before finalizing the import, the system provides a preview of the data, allowing the user to review and verify the information.
10. User reviews and confirms import. The user reviews the previewed data and confirms that they wish to proceed with the import. 
11. System integrates data into user's health record. The confirmed data is integrated into the user's consolidated health record within the aggregator's platform.
12. System establishes ongoing synchronization schedule. The system sets up a schedule to periodically sync data with the provider's FHIR endpoint, ensuring that the user's health records remain up-to-date.



## Alternative Flows

### Alternative Flow 1: Custom FHIR Endpoint
**Trigger:** Provider not in predefined list
1. User selects custom endpoint configuration
2. Provides endpoint URL and authentication details
3. System validates endpoint compatibility
4. Returns to main flow at step 4

### Alternative Flow 2: Partial Data Selection
**Trigger:** User wants specific data subset
1. User filters resource types and date ranges
2. System calculates data subset
3. Returns to main flow at step 7

## Exception Flows

### Exception 1: Authentication Failure
**Trigger:** Invalid credentials
**Handling:**
1. System displays authentication error
2. Provides troubleshooting steps
3. Allows credential reentry

### Exception 2: Endpoint Unavailable
**Trigger:** Cannot connect to endpoint
**Handling:**
1. System logs connection failure
2. Notifies user of service status
3. Schedules automatic retry

## Postconditions
1. FHIR endpoint connection is established
2. Health data is imported and normalized
3. Synchronization schedule is configured
4. Connection status is monitored
5. Access credentials are securely stored

## Business Rules
- All data transfers must be encrypted
- FHIR R4 compliance must be validated
- Data conflicts must be identified and resolved
- User must approve data synchronization
- Provider connections must be monitored
- Data provenance must be maintained

## Special Requirements

### Performance Requirements
- Connection setup < 30 seconds
- Data preview generation < 5 seconds
- Support for multiple concurrent connections
- Efficient handling of large datasets

### Security Requirements
- Secure credential storage
- Encrypted data transmission
- Access token management
- Audit trail maintenance
- Compliance with HIPAA
