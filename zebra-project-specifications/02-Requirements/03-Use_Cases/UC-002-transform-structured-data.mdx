## Overview
### Description
This use case handles the transformation of structured health data into FHIR format, supporting both system-guided and user-driven approaches. It includes management of transformation strategies, mappings, and templates that can be saved and reused.

### Business Value
Ensures accurate and appropriate data transformation by:
- Combining system intelligence with user expertise
- Enabling reuse of successful transformation strategies
- Building a library of verified mappings and templates
- Supporting both automated and manual approaches

## Actors and Stakeholders
### Primary Actor
- User (Healthcare Data Manager)

### Secondary Actors
- Transformation Engine
- Validation Service
- Mapping Service
- Storage System
- Audit System

## Preconditions
1. User is authenticated and authorized
2. Source data is available
3. Transformation services are operational
4. FHIR validation services are available
5. Required mapping tools are configured

## Main Success Scenario
1. User submits structured data

2. **Input Format Validation:**
   - System identifies input format type (JSON, XML, CSV)
   - System validates format syntax/structure
   - System reports validation results to user
   - User reviews validation report
   - User confirms proceeding with valid data

3. **Strategy Selection:**
   - System analyzes data structure and content
   - System searches for existing applicable mappings/templates
   - System can either:
     a) Propose transformation strategy based on analysis
     b) Present available strategies for user selection
   - Available strategies include:
     * Saved mapping templates
     * LLM-assisted transformation
     * GUI-based mapping tools
     * Custom transformation rules
   - User can:
     * Accept system's proposal
     * Choose different strategy
     * Combine multiple approaches
     * Create new strategy

4. **Mapping Configuration:**
   - System loads selected or creates new mapping configuration
   - User can:
     * Use existing mapping template
     * Modify existing template
     * Create new mapping rules
     * Configure transformation settings
   - System generates preview of mappings
   - User reviews and adjusts mappings
   - System validates configurations
   - User can save configuration as template for future use

5. **Transformation Execution:**
   - System executes transformation using approved configuration
   - System shows transformation progress
   - System presents interim results for review
   - User validates semantic accuracy
   - User requests adjustments if needed
   - System applies approved changes
   - User confirms final transformation

6. **Template/Mapping Management:**
   - System offers to save successful transformations
   - User can:
     * Save mapping as template
     * Update existing template
     * Add annotations/descriptions
     * Set template visibility/sharing
     * Tag templates for easy search
   - System validates and stores template

7. **Completion:**
   - System stores approved transformation
   - System updates mapping/template library
   - System creates detailed audit record
   - System provides transformation summary
   - User acknowledges completion

## Alternative Flows
### Alternative Flow 1: Invalid Input Format
1. System detects format issues
2. System provides detailed validation errors
3. User reviews error report
4. User corrects data format
5. User resubmits data
6. Flow returns to main scenario

### Alternative Flow 2: Strategy Adjustment
1. User reviews initial transformation results
2. User requests different approach
3. System preserves previous configuration
4. System presents alternative strategies
5. User selects new approach
6. Flow returns to Transformation Configuration

### Alternative Flow 3: Complex Data Handling
1. System identifies complex structure
2. System recommends combined approach
3. User selects multiple strategies
4. System coordinates combined execution
5. User reviews combined results
6. Flow continues with user validation

### Alternative Flow 4: Template Management
1. User accesses template library
2. User can:
   - Search existing templates
   - View template details
   - Edit template configurations
   - Test templates with sample data
   - Share templates with team
3. System maintains template versioning
4. System tracks template usage statistics

## Exception Flows
### Exception Flow 1: Transformation Failure
1. System detects transformation issues
2. System preserves original data
3. System presents detailed error analysis
4. User reviews failure points
5. System suggests alternative approaches
6. User decides next action

### Exception Flow 2: Validation Failure
1. System detects FHIR validation issues
2. System highlights problematic transformations
3. User reviews validation errors
4. System suggests corrections
5. User applies fixes or chooses different strategy

## Post-conditions
### Success End Condition
- Data transformed according to user preferences
- FHIR resources validated
- Transformation approved by user
- Results stored and audited

### Failure End Condition
- Original data preserved
- Issues documented
- User notified of failure
- Alternative options presented

## Special Requirements
### Business Rules
1. Users can create and manage templates
2. Templates must be versioned
3. Template changes must be tracked
4. Templates can be shared with proper permissions
5. System can propose best matching templates
6. User decisions override system proposals
7. Multiple transformation attempts allowed
8. FHIR compliance required

### Performance Requirements
- Interactive response < 2 seconds
- Transformation preview < 5 seconds
- Full execution based on complexity
- Support concurrent users
- Maintain audit history

### Security Requirements
- User authentication required
- Action authorization enforced
- Data privacy maintained
- Audit trail secured
- Access controls enforced

### Template Management Requirements
1. Template version control
2. Template access control
3. Template sharing rules
4. Template validation rules
5. Template usage tracking
