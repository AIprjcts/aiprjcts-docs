## Agile Context
### User Story Reference
As a patient or healthcare provider,
I want to import health data using FHIR standards,
So that I can maintain standardized and validated health records in the system.

### Agile Metrics
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Story Points | 13 |
| Sprint/Iteration | Sprint 1 |
| Priority Level | High |
| Feature Flag | fhir_import_enabled |

### MVP Considerations
- Minimum Requirements: Support for essential FHIR resources, basic validation, error handling
- Incremental Delivery Plan: Start with core resources, add advanced features in iterations
- Feature Toggle Strategy: Enable/disable specific FHIR resource types and validation rules

### Definition of Done
1. FHIR import functionality fully implemented and tested
2. Validation rules configured and operational
3. Error handling and feedback mechanisms in place
4. Performance requirements met
5. Security review completed
6. Documentation updated
7. User acceptance testing passed

### Acceptance Criteria
1. System successfully validates and imports FHIR R4 resources
2. Provides clear feedback on validation errors
3. Maintains data integrity and relationships
4. Creates proper audit trails
5. Meets performance requirements

## Overview
### Description
This use case enables the import of health data using FHIR standards, supporting various types of clinical records, lab results, imaging data, medication records, and provider notes. It includes validation, processing, and storage of FHIR-compliant data.

### Business Value
Ensures standardized health data import while maintaining data quality, compliance, and interoperability across healthcare systems.

### Priority
High

## Actors and Stakeholders
### Primary Actor
- Patient/Healthcare Provider

### Secondary Actors
- FHIR Validation System
- Storage System
- Audit System
- Terminology Service

### Stakeholders
- Patients
- Healthcare Providers
- System Administrators
- Compliance Officers
- Data Quality Team

## Preconditions
1. User is authenticated and authorized
2. FHIR validation service is operational
3. Storage system is available
4. Required terminology services are accessible
5. Network connectivity is established

## Triggers
- User initiates FHIR data import
- System receives FHIR data through API
- Automated import process starts

## Main Success Scenario
1. User selects FHIR data for import
2. System validates FHIR format and version
3. System checks resource types and structure
4. System validates terminology bindings
5. System verifies resource references
6. System processes and stores valid data
7. System generates success confirmation
8. System creates audit trail
9. User receives import confirmation

## Alternative Flows
### Alternative Flow 1: Partial Valid Data
1. System identifies mix of valid and invalid resources
2. System processes valid resources
3. System generates report of invalid resources
4. User receives partial success notification
5. System provides guidance for invalid data

### Alternative Flow 2: Batch Processing
1. User submits multiple FHIR resources
2. System queues resources for processing
3. System processes resources in batches
4. System provides batch progress updates
5. User receives batch completion notification

## Exception Flows
### Exception Flow 1: Validation Failure
1. System detects invalid FHIR format
2. System generates validation error report
3. System preserves original data
4. User receives detailed error feedback
5. System suggests correction steps

### Exception Flow 2: System Unavailability
1. System detects service disruption
2. System saves import request
3. System notifies user of delay
4. System retries when services restore
5. User receives status updates

## Post-conditions
### Success End Condition
- FHIR data successfully imported
- Data validated and stored
- Audit trail created
- User notified of success

### Failure End Condition
- Original data preserved
- Error report generated
- User notified of failure
- Import request logged

## Special Requirements
### Business Rules
1. All FHIR resources must be R4 compliant
2. Validation must check terminology bindings
3. Resource references must be verified
4. Audit trail must be maintained
5. Privacy rules must be enforced

### Performance Requirements
- Validation response < 2 seconds
- Import processing < 5 seconds per resource
- 99.9% system availability
- Support for concurrent imports

### Security Requirements
- Encrypted data transmission
- Access control enforcement
- Audit logging
- Data privacy compliance
- Secure storage
