# Primary Care Physician as Information Recipient

## Basic Information

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Name** | Dr. James Wilson |
| **Age** | 48 |
| **Occupation** | Primary Care Physician |
| **Location** | Minneapolis, MN |
| **Education** | MD from University of Minnesota |
| **Income Level** | High |
| **Family Status** | Married, one child |

## Profile Summary

Dr. Wilson represents a primary care physician who receives shared health information from patients using the Zebra MHH platform. He is one of several healthcare providers who patients might grant access to their consolidated health data. While he maintains his own EHR system for official medical records, he appreciates when patients can provide organized, comprehensive health information, especially those with complex conditions or those seeing multiple specialists.

He values receiving clear, structured health information from his patients but doesn't need to be a primary user of the system. His interaction with Zebra MHH is primarily as a recipient of patient-shared health data, which helps him better understand his patients' overall health situation and coordinate with other providers when necessary.
