# Clinical Research Specialist as Information Recipient

## Basic Information

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Name** | Dr. Alex Zhang |
| **Age** | 39 |
| **Occupation** | Clinical Trial Researcher & Genetic Research Specialist |
| **Location** | San Francisco, CA |
| **Education** | MD, Ph.D. in Human Genetics |
| **Income Level** | High |
| **Family Status** | Single |

## Profile Summary

Dr. Zhang is a clinical researcher who receives access to patient health information through Zebra MHH when patients choose to share their data. As a specialist in rare genetic conditions, they are sometimes invited by patients to view their comprehensive health history, either because the patient is participating in their clinical trial or because the patient is seeking expertise for potential research opportunities.

They appreciate when patients can provide organized access to their complete health journey, including genetic testing results, detailed symptom progression, and treatment responses. This information helps them better understand potential trial participants and monitor enrolled patients' overall health status alongside their trial-specific data collection.

## Technical Profile

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Device Usage** | Medium |
| **Tech Comfort** | Intermediate |
| **Primary Devices** | Research workstation, tablet |
| **Frequently Used Apps** | - Primary: Clinical trial management system
- Secondary: Web-based data viewers
- Basic: Secure document access |
| **Digital Services** | - Clinical trial platforms
- Research databases

## Goals and Needs

### Primary Goals

1. View comprehensive patient health information when granted access by trial participants or potential participants, to better understand their overall health status and care journey
2. Access organized historical health records and current symptoms when patients share them, to complement trial-specific data collection

### Secondary Goals

1. Download relevant patient-shared data in standard formats for integration with research systems
2. Understand the complete care context of trial participants through patient-granted access to their health records

## Pain Points and Frustrations

### Current Challenges

1. Visibility: Limited access to patient's overall health context beyond trial-specific data collection
2. Integration: Difficulty incorporating patient-shared information with trial-specific data collection systems

### Frustrations

1. Context Gaps: Missing important health context about trial participants between scheduled trial visits
2. Access Management: Managing different levels of access granted by different patients

## Preferences and Behaviors

### Communication Preferences

- Primary: Secure web access to patient-shared information
- Secondary: Downloadable standardized reports
- Avoided: Complex new systems requiring extensive training

### Decision-Making Factors

1. Completeness: Values access to comprehensive patient histories when shared
