## 1. Introduction

Our **AI-friendly specification templates** are designed to str eamline the process of creating clear, consistent, and comprehensive documentation for your projects. By leveraging AI assistance, you can efficiently generate specifications, maintain consistency across documents, and ensure that all necessary information is included. The generated specifications, which are "live" and "iterative," can be used as input for AI assistants or tools to generate code, scripts, and more for your software project. Conversely, if you have developed code without any specification, you can use these templates as a reference to infer the specifications that your code is using and document it.

## 2. Key Definitions

Before we dive in, let's define some key terms that will be used throughout this guide:

- **AI-Friendly Specification Template**: A structured document that includes placeholders and AI instructions to guide the creation of a specification. These templates are designed to be AI-friendly, allowing the AI assistant to understand and process them effectively. They serve as a bridge between human input and AI processing, facilitating the collaborative creation of specifications.

- **Specification Document**: A detailed document generated from a template that outlines specific aspects of a project, such as requirements, designs, or implementation details. The specification serves as a definitive guide for stakeholders and team members.

- **Placeholder**: A marker within a template that indicates where specific information should be inserted. Placeholders often have a specific syntax (e.g., `${PLACEHOLDER_NAME}`) and may include instructions or options for the content to be provided, to be reviewed, make suggestions, or approve them.

---

## 3. Getting Started

### 3.1 Understand the Basics

Before you begin, it's essential to grasp how the AI-friendly specification templates and specification documents work together:

- **Specifications Templates** are the starting point. They contain the structure, placeholders, and AI instructions necessary for generating the project specification documents.

- **Specifications Documents** are the final documents you produce by filling in the templates, usually with the assistance of an AI assistant or AI-powered IDE or tool.

- **AI Assistance** helps you fill in the templates, ensuring completeness and consistency.

### 7.2 Structure and Location

Organize support documents within a dedicated `support/` folder to maintain separation from generic templates and generated specifications.

### 7.3 Naming Conventions

Maintain clear and consistent naming conventions to ensure ease of access and reference:

- **Documentation Files:** Use descriptive names that reflect their content.  
  Example: `api-overview.md`, `coding-standards.pdf`
  
- **Design Files:** Include context in the file name for easy identification.  
  Example: `login-page-wireframe.png`, `dashboard-style-guide.pdf`
  
- **Asset Files:** Use standardized prefixes or categorizations.  
  Example: `logo-main.svg`, `icon-search.png`

### 7.4 Integration with Templates

Ensure that your templates can access these support documents efficiently:

- **Relative Paths:** Use relative paths in your templates to reference support documents.  
  Example:
  ```markdown
  For more details, refer to the [API Documentation](../../support/documentation/api-overview.md).
  ```
  
- **Dynamic Inference (If Supported):** If the AI model has vision capabilities, design files in the `support/designs/` folder can be analyzed to extract style guidelines or design patterns automatically.

### 7.5 Updating Support Documents

Maintain the support documents to reflect the latest project information:

- **Version Control:** Track changes using version control systems to manage updates effectively.
- **Consistency Checks:** Regularly verify that support documents align with the current templates and specifications.
