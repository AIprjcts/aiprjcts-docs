Definition:

- Threat Modeling identifies potential security threats and vulnerabilities.
- It helps in designing countermeasures to mitigate risks.

Instructions:

- Document identified threats, affected components, and mitigation strategies.
- Replace placeholders with specific content.

# Threat Modeling

## 1. Introduction

- **Purpose**: [Explain the objective of this threat modeling exercise]
- **Scope**: [Define the boundaries, e.g., specific modules or the entire system]

## 2. Assets and Entry Points

- **Assets**:
  - [List critical assets, e.g., User Data, Financial Transactions]
- **Entry Points**:
  - [List all entry points, e.g., Login API, Admin Portal]

## 3. Identified Threats

| Threat ID | Threat Description                  | Affected Asset  | Risk Level (High/Med/Low) |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| T-01      | SQL Injection via login form        | User Data       | High                      |
| T-02      | Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in chat  | User Sessions   | Medium                    |
| ...       |                                     |                 |                           |

## 4. Threat Analysis

### T-01: SQL Injection via Login Form

- **Description**: [Detailed explanation of the threat]
- **Affected Components**: [e.g., Authentication Service]
- **Potential Impact**: [e.g., Unauthorized data access]
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Use prepared statements with parameterized queries.
  - Validate and sanitize all user inputs.

### T-02: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Chat

- [Similar structure]

## 5. Mitigation Plan

- **Immediate Actions**: [List actions to be taken immediately]
- **Long-Term Strategies**: [Plans for ongoing security improvement]

## 6. Residual Risks

- [List any risks that cannot be fully mitigated and how they will be managed]

## 7. Conclusion

- [Summarize the overall security posture and next steps]

**Final Reminders:**

- Regularly update the threat model as the system evolves.
- Collaborate with the security team for comprehensive coverage.
- Remove instructional text before finalizing.
