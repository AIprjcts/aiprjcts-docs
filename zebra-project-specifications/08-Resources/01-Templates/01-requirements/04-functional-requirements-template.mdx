<!--
Definition of this template:

- Functional Requirements specify what the system MUST do - the actual behaviors and functions the software needs to perform.
- They define specific capabilities, behaviors, and system features in concrete, measurable terms.
- Each requirement should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

Instructions for this template:

- Copy and rename this file when creating new functional requirements.
- Replace all placeholders within square brackets [] with specific content.
- Examples are provided within the placeholders for guidance.
- Remove any instructional comments from the final document.
- Fields marked with **(Required)** are mandatory.

### FR-[number] **(Required)**

#### Metadata

- **Title (Required)**: [Descriptive Title, e.g., "User Authentication System"]

- **Priority (Required)**: [High/Medium/Low]
- **Status**: [Proposed/Approved/Implemented]

#### Requirement Description

> [Detailed description of what the system must do, e.g., "The system must provide secure user authentication using email and password credentials."]

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Functional Criteria**
   - [Specific testable requirement, e.g., "Users must be able to log in using their email and password"]
   - [Second requirement, e.g., "System must validate email format"]
   - [...]

2. **Technical Criteria**
   - [Technical specification, e.g., "Passwords must be hashed using bcrypt"]
   - [Second specification, e.g., "JWT tokens must expire after 24 hours"]
   - [...]

#### Dependencies

- [List related requirements or systems, e.g., "FR-01-000: User Database Schema"]

#### Implementation Notes

- **Technical Constraints**:
  - [Technical limitation, e.g., "Must use OAuth 2.0 protocol"]
  - [Second constraint, e.g., "Must support multiple authentication providers"]
  
- **Integration Points**:
  - [Integration requirement, e.g., "Must integrate with existing user database"]
  - [Second integration, e.g., "Must support SSO with Google workspace"]

#### Validation Method

- [Testing approach, e.g., "Automated integration tests for all authentication flows"]
- [Second method, e.g., "Security penetration testing of authentication endpoints"]

#### Security Considerations

- [Security requirement, e.g., "Must implement rate limiting for failed login attempts"]
- [Second consideration, e.g., "Must log all authentication attempts"]
