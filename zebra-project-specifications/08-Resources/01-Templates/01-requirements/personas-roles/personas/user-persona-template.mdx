{/* 
Template: User Persona
Version: 1.0
Purpose: Capture detailed user persona information for project requirements
*/}

{/* 
TEMPLATE USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Replace all ${PLACEHOLDER} markers with actual content
2. Remove all template comments and instructions
3. Validate against the schema defined in metadata
4. Update relationships as needed
*/}

{/* AI-CONTEXT: Document Purpose
This template serves as a base for creating user personas.
Key points:
1. Maintain consistency across sections
2. Ensure traceability through relationships
3. Follow validation rules for completeness
*/}

{/* 
SPECIFICATION DOCUMENT NAMING INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Each specification document resulting from applying a template gets a unique key following the pattern: ${PREFIX}-${SEQUENCE}-${DESCRIPTOR}
   Examples:
   - PER-001-admin_user_persona
   - PER-002-customer_service_persona
   - PER-003-end_user_persona

2. Key Usage in References:
   - Short reference: Use just the key (PER-001)
   - Full reference: Use complete filename (PER-001-admin_user_persona)
   - URL reference: Use path with filename
   
3. Relationship Examples:
   dependencies: ["US-001", "FR-002"]
   references: ["ARCH-001", "API-002"]
   impacts: ["TEST-001", "DOC-002"]

4. Naming Best Practices:
   - Keep descriptors clear and concise
   - Use lowercase with underscores
   - Include purpose in descriptor
   - Maintain consistent naming patterns
   - Avoid special characters

5. Auto-incrementing Rules:
   - Sequence numbers are unique within each prefix
   - Gaps in sequence are allowed
   - Deleted documents' numbers are not reused
   - New documents get next available number
