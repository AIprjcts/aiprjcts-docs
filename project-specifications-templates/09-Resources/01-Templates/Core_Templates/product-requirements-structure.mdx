As for the order of the PRD sections, here's the typical logical flow:

# PRD Structure


## CORE 

### Executive Summary

Provides overview of entire project
Should be written last but appears first
Gives stakeholders quick understanding


### Problem Statement

Defines the core problem(s) being solved
Explains why the project exists
Sets context for all requirements


### Product Goals & Objectives

High-level goals
Measurable objectives
Strategic alignment


### Scope & Limitations

Defines boundaries
What's in and out
Project constraints


## User Stories & Use Cases

User perspective
Core functionality from user view
Behavioral scenarios


Functional Requirements

Specific system behaviors
Features and functions
Concrete capabilities


Non-functional Requirements

Performance requirements
Security requirements
Scalability, reliability, etc.


Technical Requirements

Technology stack
Infrastructure needs
Integration requirements


Timeline & Milestones

Project schedule
Key deliverables
Release planning



The order is important because it follows a logical progression:

Why we're doing it (Problem & Goals)
What we're doing (Scope)
Who we're doing it for (User Stories)
What it needs to do (Functional Requirements)
How well it needs to do it (Non-functional Requirements)
How we'll do it (Technical Requirements)
When we'll do it (Timeline)
