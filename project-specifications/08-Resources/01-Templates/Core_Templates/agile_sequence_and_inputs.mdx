# Agile Documentation Sequence and Required Inputs Guide

This document serves as a reference for determining which inputs and supporting documents are needed for each type of template in an agile development process. It outlines a recommended sequence, starting from high-level strategic inputs, progressing into user-centric artifacts, then into detailed requirements, and finally implementation-level and testing documents. Each template type lists required inputs and supporting project-specific documents that the LLM or development team should have on hand.

  - Domain context or vision/scope (if not already established)
  - Epic reference for alignment
  - Relevant Personas for "As a …" clause

- **Inputs Needed:**  
  - Persona details to inform user goals
  - Acceptance criteria (testable conditions)
  - Success metrics
  - Technical constraints (if any)
  - User goals and requirements from Epics/Personas

- **Supporting Documents:**

## Conclusion

By following the sequence above and ensuring that each template type receives the necessary inputs and supporting documents, you can maintain consistency, clarity, and domain relevance. This approach helps the LLM or the development team produce high-quality, coherent specification documents for every stage of agile development.
