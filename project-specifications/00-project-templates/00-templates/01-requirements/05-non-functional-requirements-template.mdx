<!--
Definition of this template:

- Non-Functional Requirements specify HOW the system should perform its functions.
- They define quality attributes, technical constraints, and performance characteristics.
- Each requirement should be specific, measurable, and verifiable.

Instructions for this template:

- Copy and rename this file when creating new non-functional requirements.
- Replace all placeholders within square brackets [] with specific content.
- Examples are provided within the placeholders for guidance.
- Remove any instructional comments from the final document.
- Fields marked with **(Required)** are mandatory.

### NFR-[number] **(Required)**

#### Metadata

- **Title (Required)**: [Requirement Category, e.g., "System Response Time"]
- **Type**: [Performance/Security/Usability/etc., e.g., "Performance"]
- **Priority (Required)**: [High/Medium/Low]
- **Status**: [Proposed/Approved/Implemented]

#### Requirement Description

> [Detailed description of the quality attribute or constraint, e.g., "The system must respond to user interactions within specified time limits to ensure a smooth user experience."]

#### Metrics and Measurements

1. **Quantitative Metrics**
   - [Specific measurable criterion, e.g., "Page load time must be under 3 seconds for 95% of requests"]
   - [Second criterion, e.g., "API response time must be under 500ms for 99% of requests"]
   - [...]

2. **Qualitative Criteria**
   - [Quality attribute, e.g., "User interface must feel responsive and smooth"]
   - [Second attribute, e.g., "System must maintain performance under peak load"]
   - [...]

#### Validation Methods

- **Testing Approaches**:
  - [Testing methodology, e.g., "Load testing with 1000 concurrent users"]
  - [Second approach, e.g., "Performance monitoring in production environment"]

- **Monitoring**:
  - [Monitoring requirement, e.g., "Real-time performance metrics dashboard"]
  - [Second requirement, e.g., "Automated alerts for performance degradation"]

#### Implementation Considerations

- **Technical Constraints**:
  - [Technical limitation, e.g., "Must work with existing CDN infrastructure"]
  - [Second constraint, e.g., "Limited to current server resources"]
  
- **Dependencies**:
  - [Related requirement, e.g., "NFR-01-000: System Architecture"]
  - [Second dependency, e.g., "Current network infrastructure capabilities"]

#### Compliance Requirements

- [Standard/regulation, e.g., "Must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA"]
- [Second requirement, e.g., "Must meet HIPAA performance security standards"]

**Final Reminders:**

- Ensure metrics are measurable and verifiable
- Include specific validation methods
- Define clear success criteria
- Remove template instructions before finalizing
