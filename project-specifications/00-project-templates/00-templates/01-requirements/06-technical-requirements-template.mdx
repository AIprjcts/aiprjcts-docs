Definition of this template:

- Technical Requirements define the technical specifications and constraints of the system.
- They cover system architecture, technology stack, integration points, and technical constraints.
- These requirements guide the technical implementation and infrastructure decisions.

Instructions for this template:

- Copy and rename this file when creating new technical requirements.
- Replace all placeholders within square brackets [] with specific content.
- Examples are provided within the placeholders for guidance.
- Remove any instructional comments from the final document.
- Fields marked with **(Required)** are mandatory.

#### Technical Requirements **(Required)**

1. **API Requirements**
   ```json
   {
     "protocol": "HTTPS/REST",
     "authentication": "OAuth 2.0",
     "dataFormat": "FHIR R4 JSON",
     "endpoints": [
       "/Patient",
       "/Observation",
       "/Condition"
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Performance Requirements**
   - Response Time: [Metric, e.g., "< 500ms for 95% of requests"]
   - Throughput: [Metric, e.g., "100 requests/second"]
   - Availability: [Metric, e.g., "99.9% uptime"]

3. **Security Requirements**
   - Authentication: [Method, e.g., "JWT with OAuth 2.0"]
   - Encryption: [Standard, e.g., "TLS 1.3 for transit"]
   - Access Control: [Method, e.g., "RBAC with custom policies"]

#### Implementation Details

1. **Data Flow**
   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
       Patient Portal->>API Gateway: Request
       API Gateway->>Auth Service: Validate
       Auth Service->>API Gateway: Token
       API Gateway->>FHIR Server: FHIR Request
       FHIR Server->>API Gateway: FHIR Response
       API Gateway->>Patient Portal: Response
   ```

2. **Error Handling**
   | Error Type | HTTP Code | Action |
   |------------|-----------|---------|
   | [Type, e.g., "Auth Failed"] | [Code, e.g., "401"] | [Action, e.g., "Redirect to login"] |
   | [Type, e.g., "Not Found"] | [Code, e.g., "404"] | [Action, e.g., "Show error message"] |

#### Dependencies **(Required)**

1. **External Systems**
   - [System, e.g., "MedPlum FHIR Server"]
   - [System, e.g., "Auth0 Identity Provider"]

2. **Internal Components**
   - [Component, e.g., "User Management Service"]
   - [Component, e.g., "Audit Logging System"]

#### Deployment Requirements

```yaml
deployment:
