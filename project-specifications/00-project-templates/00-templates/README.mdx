## 1. Introduction

Our **AI-friendly specification templates** are designed to streamline the process of creating clear, consistent, and comprehensive documentation for your projects. By leveraging AI assistance, you can efficiently generate specifications, maintain consistency across documents, and ensure that all necessary information is included. The generated specifications, which are "live" and "iterative," can be used as input for AI assistants or tools to generate code, scripts, and more for your software project. Conversely, if you have developed code without any specification, you can use these templates as a reference to infer the specifications that your code is using and document it.

## 2. Key Definitions

Before we dive in, let's define some key terms that will be used throughout this guide:

- **AI-Friendly Specification Template**: A structured document that includes placeholders and AI instructions to guide the creation of a specification. These templates are designed to be AI-friendly, allowing the AI assistant to understand and process them effectively. They serve as a bridge between human input and AI processing, facilitating the collaborative creation of specifications.

- **Specification Document**: A detailed document generated from a template that outlines specific aspects of a project, such as requirements, designs, or implementation details. The specification serves as a definitive guide for stakeholders and team members.

- **Placeholder**: A marker within a template that indicates where specific information should be inserted. Placeholders often have a specific syntax (e.g., `${PLACEHOLDER_NAME}`) and may include instructions or options for the content to be provided, to be reviewed, make suggestions, or approve them.

---

## 3. Getting Started

### 3.1 Understand the Basics

Before you begin, it's essential to grasp how the AI-friendly specification templates and specification documents work together:

- **Specifications Templates** are the starting point. They contain the structure, placeholders, and AI instructions necessary for generating the project specification documents.

- **Specifications Documents** are the final documents you produce by filling in the templates, usually with the assistance of an AI assistant or AI-powered IDE or tool.

- **AI Assistance** helps you fill in the templates, ensuring completeness and consistency.
